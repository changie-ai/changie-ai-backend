# Prompt-Based Audio Tool 🎧

An early-stage experiment that lets you **process audio using natural-language prompts**.

Instead of building complex plugin chains, you describe the sound you want — the tool handles the processing.

---

## What is this?

This project explores a new way to work with audio using text prompts.

You provide:
- an audio file
- a prompt describing the desired sound or effect

The system processes the audio and outputs a transformed version.

---

## Example Prompts

Here are a few example prompts that reflect the creative direction of this project:

- **“Make it sound like a Travis Scott–style delay with a huge stadium reverb.”**

- **“Reverse the audio and slow it down by 40 percent.”**

- **“Apply extreme T-Pain–style robotic autotune with a small room reverb.”**

- **“Generate a three-part vocal harmony in the key of C.”**

Prompts can be combined or experimented with freely.

---

## Why?

Modern audio tools are powerful, but they can be slow and technical.

This project asks a simple question:

**What if shaping sound felt more like describing it?**

---

## Status

⚠️ Early / experimental  
Expect rough edges. Things may change.

---

## How to use (basic)

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run the app  
4. Process an audio file with a prompt  

(Detailed instructions will evolve as the project matures.)

---

## What’s next

- Better audio quality
- More expressive prompt control
- Easier setup
- UI and plugin experiments
